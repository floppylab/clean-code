# Hangman

A very simple command line game. The original code is not too long but it is buggy, unreadable and it is not easy to add a new feature. Simply said, it is a piece of legacy code you can improve your refactoring skills with.

## Steps to complete

Each step should fit in 45-60 minutes.

- Get to know the code, run it a few times, write some end-to-end tests
- Try to make modules, extract methods, classes from the code
- Write unit tests
- Rethink style, rename variables, change used data structures
- Refactor hangman drawing and communication with user, deal with error messages
- Add new feature: storing letters and check if entered again

## Languages

Feel free to add a new language to the list. Please try to keep the original mistakes, structure, so that everyone can work on the "exact same" bugs, making similar improvements.
